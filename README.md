# 📚 SYDE 121 Library System

## Overview
This is a C++ group project for the SYDE 121 course at the University of Waterloo. The program simulates a real **Library System** that allows managing a collection of books and library users (eg. students and teachers). The system provides functionality for adding, removing, and searching for books, along with storing and displaying user information.
